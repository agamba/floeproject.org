The [SNOW](https://snow.idrc.ocadu.ca/) project team has published two guides about Open Educational Resources for
educators and educational content creators. The guides, created with community input, including educators and learners,
offer practical ways to begin using and creating open educational resource materials whether educators are remote or in
person.

OER and open education practices can support educators in meeting the learning needs of diverse cohorts by fostering a
global community to contribute to the collective production of a range of learning resources to meet a learning goal for
a range of learning needs.

The guides are published on the SNOW website for Inclusive Learning and Education, and OERCommons:

* [Open Educational Resources](https://snow.idrc.ocadu.ca/the-inclusive-classroom/open-educational-resources/)
* [Inclusive Design for Learning: An educator's guide to Open Educational Resources (OER)](https://www.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/69462)

Additional resources about Open Education will be added in the new year.
