The FLOE Project is working with the [Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure](http://gpii.net) to provide learners with
friendly and comprehensive tools for sharing their data with the web sites, access features and assistive technologies
that they trust. These tools will give learners complete control over which preferences are shared with any GPII-enabled
services.

For more information and to see an example of the security architecture in action, please see the video below.
