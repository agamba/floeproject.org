## Abstract

> Globally, children with disabilities are disadvantaged in the school environment. Some studies have shown that they
> are also disproportionately represented among out-of-school children (Saebones et al., 2015). Inclusive Design for
> Learning provides a means to address this crisis of exclusion of persons with identified and unidentified
> disabilities, which may be permanent or episodic. Through the individualisation and adaptation of learning materials
> enabled by open education practices and the flexibility of digital resources, excluded or struggling learners can be
> included, to the benefit of all learners. This Knowledge Series paper introduces the dimensions of inclusive design as
> it applies to learning and focuses on the design of diverse learning experiences to help optimise learning
> opportunities for all learners.
