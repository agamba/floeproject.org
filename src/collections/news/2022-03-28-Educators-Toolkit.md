collection of techniques and strategies to help create and set up an accessible
environment for coding education. The

about coding including kids with complex needs who have been left out of coding
education. The coding environment is customizable and simplifiable enabling each
kid to enjoy it the way they prefer. Detailed facilitation guides for
