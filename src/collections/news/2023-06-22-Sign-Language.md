title: Sign Languages In Websites

excerpt: Promising approaches for integrating sign languages like ASL and LSQ into a website.

---

While co-designing a platform intended to be used by people who use ASL, LSQ, English and
French, it became clear that very few websites include sign languages in their sites at
all. The Deaf individuals participating in co-design noted that not only are ASL and LSQ
used by the Deaf community, but also that there are many Deaf people who donâ€™t read or
write English or French and rely on sign language to access content.

The Floe team has distilled the year long process of co-designing a viable and inclusive
solution into an open resource that describes some promising approaches to
[integrating sign languages into websites](https://handbook.floeproject.org/techniques/how-to-integrate-sign-language-into-your-website/).
Work on the platform that inspired this resource is ongoing and the Floe team will update
the resource with new learnings as they are discovered.
