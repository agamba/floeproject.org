The Coding to Learn project team created a [co-design kit](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/C2LC/Coding+to+Learn+and+Create+Co-Design+Kit)
aimed at engaging kids with complex disabilities in coding skills and education. The growing collection of activities
includes multi-modal collaborative art creation.

Since the COVID-19 isolation period, the team has explored remote coding and creativity workshops. Working with
teachers, parents and students with complex disabilities, the team is developing a set of activities and processes to
engage students remotely. These new insights will be added to the co-design kit in the coming weeks.

[The Inclusive Coding Environment](https://create.weavly.org/) is being developed through a collaborative co-design
process, currently including remote co-design coding sessions.

An [Educatorâ€™s Toolkit](https://weavly.org/learn/) has been created to provide teachers with resources for teaching
coding to diverse students. The toolkit will be redesigned and new resources will be added in the coming year.
