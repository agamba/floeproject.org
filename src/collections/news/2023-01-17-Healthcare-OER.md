excerpt: Co-designing educational materials for healthcare providers on working with clients with low vision and blindness.

---

Blind, deafblind, and partially sighted individuals face many barriers while accessing
healthcare services including inaccessible healthcare resources, difficult interactions
with providers, and inaccessible physical and digital spaces. At the root of these issues
is the lack of practitioner knowledge and competency in topics related to low vision and
blindness.

The Floe project is working with researchers and educators at Queenâ€™s University to
bring together people with low vision and blindness, healthcare providers and
curriculum creators to codesign and create educational materials that all healthcare
providers can use to address these issues.
