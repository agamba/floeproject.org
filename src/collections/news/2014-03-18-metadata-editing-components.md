The Floe team is developing a suite of tools for creating more accessible and personalizable web content by supporting
the creation of accessibility metadata. These tools will allow content creators to easily generate metadata at the point
of creation, reducing the cost and complexity of pro-ducing and delivering content that can be tailored to a userâ€™s
needs and preferences.

A [demo](https://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/metadata/index.html) of the latest work illustrates the metadata that
can be automatically generated during the process of adding a video to an OER. By building tools that focus on content
creation at the point of authoring, Floe prioritizes accessibility metadata while providing built-in solutions suitable
for any content authoring system.
