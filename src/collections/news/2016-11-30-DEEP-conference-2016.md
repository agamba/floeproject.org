On <time datetime="2016-10-13">October 13</time>-<time datetime="2016-10-14">14, 2016</time> the [DEEP - Discovery conference](https://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca/)
brought together an international community of over 100 diverse participants to discuss timely, difficult, and engaging
topics.

This year’s theme was: “Our Data: Who owns it, who controls it, what can we
do with it?”

DEEP 2016 welcomed the participation of four initiatives that each brought essential perspectives to the agenda, namely:
international collaboration, platforms for inclusive prosperity, privacy, and life-long learning. The EU project
Discovery, the SSHRC supported TIPP consortium, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner supported project on privacy and
inclusion, and several open education projects all participated in DEEP 2016. Participation from each of these projects
helps to ensure that conversations and plans will be acted upon and the work started at DEEP will continue well beyond
the conference.
