User Interface Options, also known as Learner Options, provides individuals with the ability to customize a web site to
meet their personal needs and preferences. Currently, to provide such customizations, the web page needs to incorporate
the UI Options widget into the site's markup. However, not every site will have UI Options or site personalizations
incorporated.

User Interface Options Plus (UIO+) aims to address this issue by enabling the personalization experience of UI Options
as a browser extension. Preferences can be set via the UIO+ adjuster panel or, if on a
[GPII (Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure)](https://gpii.net/) enabled machine, from a keyed in preference set.

We have recently published a beta of [UIO+](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%20/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek)
to the Chrome Web Store.

The following preferences are currently supported:

* Text Size
* Line Space
* Contrast
* Right-Click to Select
* Selection Highlight
* Text-to-Speech (requires the [click2speech](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/click2speech/djfpbemmcokhlllnafdmomgecdlicfhj)
  extension)
* Reading Mode
* Table of Contents
* Enhance Inputs
* Dictionary (requires the [Google dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja)
  extension)

_**Note**: The ability to apply an adaptation will vary from page to page._

UIO+ is still early in development. We aim to improve/expand preference options and support additional browsers in the
future.

UIO+ is the result of a joint effort of the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/) at
[OCAD University](https://www.ocadu.ca/) and the [Trace R&D Center](https://trace.umd.edu/) at
[University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) under funding for the [FLOE Project](https://floeproject.org/) from the
[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation](https://www.hewlett.org/) and the
[National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)](https://acl.gov/about-acl/about-national-institute-disability-independent-living-and-rehabilitation-research),
[Administration for Community Living](https://www.acl.gov/) under grant #90RE5027.
