The FLOE Team is developing starter kits to accelerate the development of web sites; providing a solid foundation to
build from and maintain over time.

[Trivet](https://github.com/fluid-project/trivet) is a simple starter kit to create accessible, localizable static sites
with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev). Trivet was used to create
[Accessibility in Action](https://accessibility-in-action.inclusivedesign.ca) and the
[Community-Led Co-design kit](https://co-design.inclusivedesign.ca), and port the
[Inclusive Design Guide](https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca) and the
[Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](https://handbook.floeproject.org) to Eleventy.

[Hearth](https://github.com/fluid-project/hearth) will support the creation of and access to libraries of open
educational resources. Hearth is a starter kit for the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, providing the following
out of the box:

* A user model with login, registration, email verification, and optional two-factor authentication.
* An organization model.
* A membership model which reflects users' roles within organizations.
* An invitation model which allows users to be invited to join organizations.
* A resource model supporting creation of and access to a library of open educational resources in a wide range of
  formats.
* Multilingual support, including localized routes.
* Bare bones views which can be published and customized as needed.
