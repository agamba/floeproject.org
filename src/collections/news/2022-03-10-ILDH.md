The [Inclusive Learning Design Handbook](https://handbook.floeproject.org/) has
been refreshed to make it easier for learners and educators to find techniques
and approaches for creating adaptable and personalizable educational resources
that can accommodate a diversity of learning preferences and individual needs.

Floe is continuing work on the site and will soon launch a set of recommendations
for creating inclusive, accessible audio tactile graphics.
