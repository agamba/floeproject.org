Through FLOE, the IDRC recently participated in a panel discussion at the
[Indigeverse Multimedia Festival](https://www.indigeverse.org/).
Together with other project team members, we presented an overview of some
recent work on an ecocultural mapping project. The presentation was a preview of
an upcoming Indigenous Design Collective workshop, where we will discuss the
project in more detail.

In partnership with Indigenous and non-Indigenous partners, the project aims to
co-create an inclusive, participatory mapping program in the Salish Sea that
integrates Indigenous ways of knowing and Western ecological science into an
interactive ecocultural mapping tool. The pilot project, led by Jeannine Georgeson,
an Indigenous member of the Galiano community, is focused on a specific location
on Galiano Island (a gulf island off the coast of Vancouver, BC) named Xetthecum
in the Hul’qumi’num language.

The Xetthecum project is part of a larger initiative begun by Shirley Williams and
others at [Whiteswan Environmental](https://www.whiteswanenvironmental.org/),
an Indigenous-led non profit organization in Washington State. Through the
Spirit of the Sxwo’le (SOS) coalition, Whiteswan is collaborating with
[IMERSS](https://imerss.org/), the Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological
Research in the Salish Sea.

(excerpted in the presentation) is available.
