The [National Business and Disability Council (NBDC)](https://www.viscardicenter.org/services/natl-business-disability-council/)
at [The Viscardi Center](https://www.viscardicenter.org/) is offering an educational online workshop to focus on
designing for diversity.

No one needs to point out that the current business climate is in a state of flux and transformation. To thrive requires
a good measure of agility, responsiveness, continuous innovation and dynamic resiliency. These qualities are the
by-products of broadly diverse perspectives, skills, and approaches combined with the conditions that foster their
inclusion. Fortuitously, emerging technologies and associated practices make it viable to move beyond mass design – in
policy, communication, product development, service, marketing, training and other business practices – and make special
the norm. If we proactively design for diversity we not only comply with legislative requirements for accessibility but
we also reap the benefits of flexibility, adaptability and a spectrum of possible approaches, to thrive in a quickly
evolving business climate.
