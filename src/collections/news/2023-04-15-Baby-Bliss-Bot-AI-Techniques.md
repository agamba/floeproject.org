excerpt: Exploring AI Machine Learning models with Bliss symbols.

A number of different artificial intelligence machine learning systems were
explored in order to acquire a basic knowledge of such systems, how to train
them, and what they produce, as well as an idea of their value to the
[Baby Bliss Bot Project](https://floeproject.org/news/2023-04-12-introduction-of-baby-bliss-bot-project/).

## StyleGAN: StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3

A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) is a machine learning framework for
a type of AI that generates fake content after being trained with a large set
of real data.  An example is shown on the
[Random Face Generator (This Person Does Not Exist)](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en),
website where the images of faces that are produced are not of actual people.
Instead the GAN, which has been trained on many pictures of actual faces,
composes a new face based on what it has learned from its training.

Nvidia has developed a type of a progressive GAN called a [StyleGAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StyleGAN).
The system is trained first with low resolution images, and as training
proceeds, higher resolutions are progressively introduced.

There are several versions of StyleGAN.  We investigated two of them:
StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3.

### StyleGAN2-ADA

The relevant aspect of StyleGAN2-ADA is that this version of StyleGAN can be
trained using a small data set of data.  In that regard, there are only 1,217
distinct single Bliss symbols out of 6,000+ total symbols.  Greyscale images
of the single Bliss symbols were used as the training set.  These are shown
in the following array of symbols:

character Bliss symbols">

Guided by the article [How to Train StyleGAN2-ADA with Custom Dataset](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-train-stylegan2-ada-with-custom-dataset-dc268ff70544),
the 1,216 single Bliss symbols were used to train the network.
Training was conducted over several runs for total training time of 62 hours.
The following figure show an array of the final fake images of Bliss symbols
generated by the GAN:

symbol images as generated by StyleGAN2-ADA">

As can be seen, the fake images have a superficial resemblance to real Bliss
symbols and it appears that the GAN has detected and learned some patterns
within the single Bliss symbols. At the present time it is unclear what
patterns the GAN has learned exactly.  This is an issue for potential future
explorations of GAN machine learning models.
