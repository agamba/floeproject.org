    The Guide for Reducing Barriers to Virtual Health and its accompanying
    Personal Preferences Approach to Personalizing Healthcare is now available.

Two new health related Open Educational Resources are now available: the [Guide for Reducing Barriers to Virtual Health](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/IUIGFVP/Guide+for+Reducing+Barriers+to+Virtual+Healthcare)
and its accompanying [Personal Preferences Approach to personalizing healthcare](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/IUIGFVP/Section+-+Software+Approaches+for+Expressing+Personal+Preferences+for+Healthcare).

The guide has two main purposes: 1) to identify the virtual healthcare needs of Canadians and 2) to provide guidance for
reducing the barriers in receiving care. The guide incorporates the input and collaboration of co-design participants of
various lived experiences and backgrounds, and healthcare practitioners from across Canada. It also includes insights
from literature research and the project team's collective experiences in Inclusive Design. For more information on the
methodology used to create this initial version of the guide, please visit this wiki page:
[Methodology used to create the Guide](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/IUIGFVP/Methodology+used+to+create+the+Guide).

The Personal Preferences Approach explores a system that allows for the expression of personal preferences for virtual
healthcare and responding to these preferences in a meaningful way that reduces barriers. This system is informed by the
principles, practices, and approaches from the Guide for Reducing Barriers to Virtual Healthcare and builds on previous
work for [UI Options](/ui-options/). Although this approach is contextualized for healthcare, the ideas can be applied
to other domains such as education, and more.

As always, this work is not intended to be complete or static. Input, participation, and
further evolution of these ideas is welcome!
