excerpt: Learning modules to improve healthcare service delivery for people with vision loss.

---

Four new learning modules intended for healthcare practitioners are now available on the
[eCampus Ontario](https://openlibrary.ecampusontario.ca/item-details/#/78b6d37d-99d1-408f-8732-80aa8deb58cb)
site. Through the use of case studies, reflective questions and supporting information,
the modules will assist healthcare providers in creating a more accesible experience
for clients with vision loss.

The modules and their companion guides were created through a co-design process which
included people with lived experiece of vision loss as well as healthcare providers.
New modules are currently being worked on and will be added to this set of resources.
