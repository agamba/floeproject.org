W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative will be hosting an Accessible E-Learning online symposium on
<time datetime="2013-12-16">December 16, 2013</time>. They are currently inviting submission of new research, ongoing

Learning and education are the enablers of social and economic change. E-learning systems allow instructors and students
to interact synchronously and asynchronously from any part of the world that has a viable internet connection. This
symposium will explore the relationship between content accessibility and interface accessibility, accessibility of
e-learning environments used in non-conventional contexts, privacy issues in profiling learners and e-learning
environments users, and other important topics.

Participation in the symposium is free.
