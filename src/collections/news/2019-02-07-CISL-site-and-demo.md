The [Center on Inclusive Software for Learning (CISL)](https://cisl.cast.org/) is creating a suite of innovative tools to
create, discover and use accessible,
adaptable digital learning resources.

Led by [CAST](https://www.cast.org/) and funded by the U.S Department of Education's
[Office of Special Education Programs](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html), the CISL suite
will make digital educational materials accessible, flexible, and engaging for all students.

The FLOE project is working as a partner on the CISL project to integrate FLOE tools such as
[Learner Options](https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/) into the
[CISL Reader](http://cisl-demo.cast.org/index-readium.html?pub=serp-paper-or-plastic) and other parts of the software
suite, and to apply its principles of inclusive design for learning.
