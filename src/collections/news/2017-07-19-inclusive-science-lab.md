We've been building an integration technology called the [Nexus](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308092347/https://wiki.gpii.net/w/The_Nexus).
It allows the interconnection of arbitrary devices by co-ordinating device state over HTTP and WebSockets.

Using the Nexus we have been exploring designs to make science labs more inclusive. We used the Nexus to connect lab
sensors, such as pH sensors and electrical conductivity sensors, to a range of different presentations and interactions.
This helps a student pick the interaction that works best for them. For some students this might be a visualization and
for others it might be a sonification, or a combination of different presentations.

Calum and Miles joined us to try out an inclusive science lab design, and helped us make a video about their experiences:
