excerpt: A presentation of the ecocultural mapping project in the Salish Sea.

The IDRC recently participated in a panel discussion at the
[Indigeverse Multimedia Festival](https://www.indigeverse.org/).
Together with other project team members, we presented an overview of some recent
work on an ecocultural mapping project. The presentation was a preview of an
upcoming Indigenous Design Collective workshop, where we will explore the project
in more detail.

Through FLOE, the IDRC is participating in a collaborative, ecocultural mapping
project focused on an area in the Pacific Northwest known as the Salish Sea. In
partnership with Indigenous and non-Indigenous partners, this project aims to
co-create an inclusive, participatory mapping program in the Salish Sea that
integrates Indigenous ways of knowing and Western ecological science into an
interactive ecocultural mapping tool.

The pilot project is focused on a specific location on Galiano Island (a gulf
island off the coast of Vancouver, BC) named Xetthecum in the Hul’qumi’num language.
The Xetthecum project is part of a larger initiative begun by Shirley Williams
and others at [Whiteswan Environmental](https://www.whiteswanenvironmental.org/),
an Indigenous-led non profit organization in Washington State. Through the Spirit
of the Sxwo’le   (SOS) coalition, Whiteswan and the IDRC are collaborating with
[IMERSS](https://imerss.org/), the Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological
Research in the Salish Sea.
