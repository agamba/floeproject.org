We're pleased to announce that tools and knowledge from FLOE work on inclusive open
education will be a part of to the newly-announced
[Center on Inclusive Software for Learning (CISL)](https://cisl.cast.org/) as part of the
[Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/)'s partnership on the project.

Led by [CAST](https://www.cast.org/) and funded by the the U.S. Department of Education's
[Office of Special Education Programs](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html), CISL will support
the development of an open-source software suite, industry guidelines and suporting research to ensure K-12 students get
engaging personalized learning through Open Education Resources.

We look forward to working with CAST and project partner [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/) on advancing the
state of the art in inclusive open education with FLOE!
